Alembic Database Migrations
===========================

This directory contains database migration scripts for Onless.uz backend.

## Commands

Generate a new migration after model changes:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add user table"
```

Apply migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Rollback one migration:
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

Show current revision:
```bash
alembic current
```

Show migration history:
```bash
alembic history
```

## Best Practices

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a development database first
3. Include both upgrade() and downgrade() functions
4. Use meaningful migration messages
5. Never edit applied migrations - create new ones instead
